<details>
<summary>About Me</summary>

Hey! My name is Eric Miao, currently studying at the University of Toronto. I have years of experience in programming, mainly with Python and Java.
I am also currently working on a big AI project for fun!

Even though I spend lots of time in front of VSCode and Google, I also have lots of hobbies I enjoy. Some notable ones are driving manuals, piloting boats, currently learning
how to pilot an aircraft, going to gun ranges and airgun ranges, biking, 3D printing, and just chillin at home watching YouTube and learning new things. There are tons of
things I also ambitiously want to achieve, including getting a motorcycle license, a pilot's license for both aircrafts and helicopters (long term goal), finishing the big AI
project before the next decade, and travel around the world :D

Well, that's all I have so far that I want to present to you. Below are just some more information about me and my skill sets. **Plz hire me**
